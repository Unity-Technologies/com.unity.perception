Don't Be a Jerk: The Open Source Software License.
Adapted from: https://github.com/evantahler/Dont-be-a-Jerk


_I_ am the software author - JohannesMP on Github.
_You_ are the user of this software. You might be a _we_, and that's OK!

This is free, open source software. I will never charge you to use,
license, or obtain this software. Doing so would make me a jerk.

You may use the content of this project (and by "project" I mean the immediate 
directory containing this license, and all its files) for whatever you want. 
Personal use, Educational use, Corporate use, and all other uses are OK!

I offer no warranty on anything in this project, and you are using it at
your own risk, of your own free will. I've tried my best to ensure that 
there are no gaping security holes where using this software might erase
your hard drive or give you constipation, but it might happen. I'm sorry. 
However, I warned you, so you can't sue me. Suing people over free 
software would make you a jerk.

If you find bugs, it would be nice if you let me know so I can fix them.
You don't have to, but it would be appreciated.

Speaking of bugs, I am not obligated to fix anything, nor am I obligated 
to add any features for you, though I will consider your suggestions. 
Feeling entitled about free software would make you a jerk.

If you add a new feature or fix a bug, it would be nice if you contributed 
it back to the project, but you don't have to. The repository/site you 
obtained this software from should contain a way for you to contact me. 
Contributing to open source makes you awesome!

If you use this software, you may remove this license, and don't have to
give me any credit, but it would be great if you did.

Don't be a jerk. Enjoy your free software! :)
