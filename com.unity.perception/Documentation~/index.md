# Unity Perception package (com.unity.perception)
The Perception package provides a toolkit for generating large-scale datasets for perception-based machine learning training and validation. It is focused on capturing ground truth for camera-based use cases for now and will ultimately expand to other forms of sensors and machine learning tasks.

> The Perception package is in active development. Its features and API are subject to significant change as development progresses.

## Example projects using Perception

### SynthDet

[SynthDet](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/SynthDet) is an end-to-end solution for training a 2d object detection model using synthetic data.

### Unity Simulation Smart Camera Example

The [Unity Simulation Smart Camera Example](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Simulation-Smart-Camera-Outdoor) illustrates how Perception could be used in a smart city or autonomous vehicle simulation. Datasets can be generated locally or at scale in [Unity Simulation](https://unity.com/products/unity-simulation).
