# Unity Perception package (com.unity.perception)
The Perception package provides a toolkit for generating large-scale datasets for perception-based machine learning training and validation. It is focused on capturing ground truth for camera-based use cases for now and will ultimately expand to other forms of sensors and machine learning tasks.

> The Perception package is in active development. Its features and API are subject to significant change as development progresses.
