# Perception Package ([Unity Computer Vision](https://unity.com/computer-vision))

The Perception package provides a toolkit for generating large-scale datasets for computer vision training and validation. It is focused on a handful of camera-based use cases for now and will ultimately expand to other forms of sensors and machine learning tasks.

## Getting Started

**[Quick Installation Instructions](com.unity.perception/Documentation~/SetupSteps.md)**  
Get your local Perception workspace up and running quickly. Recommended for users with prior Unity experience.

**[Perception Tutorial](com.unity.perception/Documentation~/Tutorial/TUTORIAL.md)**  
Detailed instructions covering all the important steps from installing Unity Editor, to creating your first computer vision data generation project, building a randomized Scene, and generating large-scale synthetic datasets by leveraging the power of Unity Simulation.  No prior Unity experience required.

**[Human Pose Labeling and Randomization Tutorial](com.unity.perception/Documentation~/HPTutorial/TUTORIAL.md)**  
Step by step instructions for using the keypoint, pose, and animation randomization tools included in the Perception package. It is recommended that you finish Phase 1 of the Perception Tutorial above before starting this tutorial.

**[FAQ](com.unity.perception/Documentation~/FAQ/FAQ.md)**  
Check out our FAQ for a list of common questions, tips, tricks, and some sample code.

**[Verifying Datasets with Dataset Insights](com.unity.perception/Documentation~/Tutorial/DatasetInsights.md)**  
Introduction to Unity's [Dataset Insights](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/datasetinsights) â€“ a python package for downloading, parsing and analyzing synthetic datasets.

## Documentation
In-depth documentation on individual components of the package. 

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|[Labeling](com.unity.perception/Documentation~/GroundTruthLabeling.md)|A component that marks a GameObject and its descendants with a set of labels|
|[Label Config](com.unity.perception/Documentation~/GroundTruthLabeling.md#label-config)|An asset that defines a taxonomy of labels for ground truth generation|
|[Perception Camera](com.unity.perception/Documentation~/PerceptionCamera.md)|Captures RGB images and ground truth from a [Camera](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Camera.html).|
|[Dataset Capture](com.unity.perception/Documentation~/DatasetCapture.md)|Ensures sensors are triggered at proper rates and accepts data for the JSON dataset.|
|[Randomization](com.unity.perception/Documentation~/Randomization/Index.md)|The Randomization tool set lets you integrate domain randomization principles into your simulation.|

## Community and Support

For setup problems or discussions about leveraging the Perception package in your project, please create a new thread on the **[Unity Computer Vision forum](https://forum.unity.com/forums/computer-vision.626/)** and make sure to include as much detail as possible. If you run into any other problems with the Perception package or have a specific feature request, please submit a **[GitHub issue](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.perception/issues)**.

For any other questions or feedback, connect directly with the Computer Vision team at [computer-vision@unity3d.com](mailto:computer-vision@unity3d.com).

## Example Projects

### SynthDet

<img src="com.unity.perception/Documentation~/images/synthdet.png"/>

[SynthDet](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/SynthDet) is an end-to-end solution for training a 2D object detection model using synthetic data.

### Robotics Object Pose Estimation Demo
<img src="com.unity.perception/Documentation~/images/robotics_pose.png"/>

The [Robotics Object Pose Estimation Demo & Tutorial](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Robotics-Object-Pose-Estimation) demonstrates pick-and-place with a robot arm in Unity. It includes using ROS with Unity, importing URDF models, collecting labeled training data using the Perception package, and training and deploying a deep learning model.

## Local development
The repository includes two projects for local development in `TestProjects` folder, one set up for HDRP and the other for URP.

### Suggested IDE Setup
For closest standards conformity and best experience overall, JetBrains Rider or Visual Studio w/ JetBrains Resharper are suggested. For optimal experience, perform the following additional steps:
* To allow navigating to code in all packages included in your project, in your Unity Editor, navigate to `Edit -> Preferences... -> External Tools` and check `Generate all .csproj files.` 

## Known issues
* Projects that use the Perception package on Windows or OS X will have a dependency for Python for Unity added to their manifest, in order for the new Dataset Visualizer tool to work. This tool and Python for Unity are not supported on Linux, therefore this dependency should be removed from the project's manifest file if the project is saved on Windows or OSX and opened on Linux.
